	For this week's assignment we took a look at TinkerCad's circuit and code block activities. The circuit work was basically a virtual Arduino which I thought was pretty cool and useful. It took the challenging issue of size out of the picture and it felt easier to use. The lessons were easy to follow and I began to understand the way circuits function on a more fundamental level. I really loved the code block activities included with this week's lesson. I'm definitely a more spacial thinker when it comes to learning so they were really enjoyable for me. When it came to designing my 3D object I immediately decided that it needed to be something jewlery related. Jewelry making is possibly my biggest passion and, with access to a 3D printing program, the possibilities are endless! With my earring design the rotate tool was super useful. I wanted all of my shapes to face forward so I used rotate to flip them on their X axis. The shapes I chose were completely random and simply chosen because I liked them. Ideally, I would make my object and paint it afterwards with bright colors as to make it a serious statement. As I was designing my piece, I really started to think about just how intricate and interesting 3D printing could be. It is truly a revolutionary technology and I look forward to watching it grow and develop.
